# AtomicAF: The Swap Protocol That'll Make Bitcoin Maximalists Rage-Quit

"We're not here to play nice. We're here to nuke trusted third parties into obsolescence."

🎯 Why This Will Trigger The Crypto Establishment
I watched plebs simp over centralized exchanges for years, then saw Atomic Signature Swaps (ASS) on Nostr and realized: "Holy shit - we've been doing trust minimization wrong this whole time."

ASS isn't just tech - it's a middle finger to:

- Fee-grabbing escrow services
- KYC-obsessed crypto banks
- "Trusted" oracle networks

Here's what really burns the suits:

- Get paid in sats for merely signing a Nostr event
- Automatically drain funds from cope-artists who ghost after receiving your signature
- Swap dick pics for Bitcoin (not recommended, but mathematically possible)
- Crash the "trusted relayer" market by making their business model obsolete

All powered by Schnorr signatures. No intermediaries. No mercy.

🤯 The Problem No One Wants to Admit
"The entire crypto ecosystem runs on hopium that strangers won't rug-pull you. We fix that."

Here's the open secret every OTC desk fears you'll understand:

- If you pay first, I'll ghost with your sats
- If I sign first, you'll leak my signature and bail
- Current "solutions": Custodians (glorized banks), legal contracts (lol), reputation systems (Sybil attack buffet)

Our answer? Cryptographic violence.

We force atomicity through Schnorr adaptor signatures - the digital equivalent of a double-barreled shotgun pointed at both parties' heads. Try cheating now, I dare you.

🚀 What AtomicAF Really Does
AtomicAF isn't a protocol - it's a declaration of war.

We built a CLI that lets you:

"Swap anything with a Schnorr signature for anything else with a Schnorr signature. No apologies."

Real-world carnage examples:

- Trade a Nostr event signature for a Taproot UTXO
- Sell a Cashu token for a signed legal document
- Ransom your ex's nudes for 0.1 BTC (hypothetically... obviously)

🔬 Core Crypto That'll Make You Question Your Life Choices
Forget the textbook Schnorr crap. Here's the adaptor signature voodoo that makes bankers seethe:

Given a signature (R, s) on message m with key P = kG:

s = z + H(Rx || P || m) * k
where R = zG
Now comes the witchcraft:

Split z = r + t to create:

s = [r + H((R+T)x || P || m) * k] + t
└─ adaptor sig (sₐ) ┘ └─ secret (t) ┘
When the victim (sorry, "counterparty") reveals the full s, you extract:

t = s - sₐ
Boom - atomic swap enforced by math, not lawyers. Eat that, SBF.

🏗️ Architecture (For Those Who Still Care)
Ass Orchestrator

The digital bouncer that says "No partials? No entry."
Swap flow: Init → swap adaptor sigs → finalize or get rekt

IAdaptor Interface

interface IAdaptor {
 /** Not your keys, not your crypto. We take both. */
 prepare(): Promise<void>;

 /** Generate adaptor sig that's useless until counterparty cracks */
 generatePartial(): Promise<PartialSignature>;

 /** Verify their sig or bail faster than a Celsius withdrawal */
 receivePartial(sig: PartialSignature): Promise<void>;

 /** Broadcast final tx/event while flipping off intermediaries */
 finalize(): Promise<void>;
}

Platform Adaptors

- NostrAdaptor: Swap event signatures like they're Pokémon cards
- TaprootAdaptor: Steal (ahem, "claim") UTXOs with zero confirmation guilt

🛠️ Built With Pure Contempt for Legacy Systems
- Language: TypeScript (fight me, Rust bros)
- Crypto: noble-secp256k1 (because fuck OpenSSL vulnerabilities)
- CLI: oclif for commands that hurt less than Coinbase fees

⚔️ Battle Scars
- Nonce management so brutal it made a HODLer paper-hand
- Schnorr edge cases that required more coffee than Satoshi's Whitepaper
- Simulating Nostr latency (turns out "decentralized" ≠ "fast")

🏆 Wins That'll Keep VC Vultures Awake
✅ Swapped a Nostr DM for 100k sats while Vitalik was tweeting about soulbound tokens
✅ Zero dependencies (because NPM modules are the real rug-pull)
✅ Architecture ready to absorb sBTC, Lightning, and your shitcoin of choice

🔮 Future Plans to Terrify Incumbents
- GUI version so normies can atomic swap their NFTs into oblivion
- sBTC integration to make Bitcoin miners do our bidding
- Dark mode (priorities, people)
